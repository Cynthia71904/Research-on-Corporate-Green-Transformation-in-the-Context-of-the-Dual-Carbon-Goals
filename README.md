# Abstract

Under China’s “Dual Carbon” goals—to achieve carbon peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060—enterprises are urged to shift from high-emission industrial models toward green, low-carbon, and sustainable development. This study examines how firms can achieve such transformation, focusing on stakeholder attitudes, strategic implementation, and lessons from successful cases.

Findings show that while governments, investors, and consumers generally support green transformation, enterprises often face challenges such as high costs, limited technology, and weak market mechanisms. Case studies of Foxconn and China Baowu Steel highlight that technological innovation, energy efficiency, and circular production are key drivers in manufacturing. In the energy sector, companies like Sinopec leverage digital technologies to enhance efficiency and reduce emissions, while the financial sector—through green credit and bonds—provides vital but still limited support.

The study concludes that corporate green transformation requires strong environmental responsibility, innovation-driven growth, and cross-industry collaboration. Only through coordinated efforts among government, business, and society can China’s Dual Carbon objectives be effectively achieved.
